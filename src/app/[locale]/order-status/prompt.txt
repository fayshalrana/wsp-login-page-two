Order Status Dashboard Implementation
Here is the refined implementation plan based on the provided requirements for the Order Status Dashboard using Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

General Requirements:
Layout & Structure:

Header: Displays restaurant logo, name, current time, and fullscreen button.
Orders Grid: Two columns — Preparing (left) and Ready (right).
Order Number Cards: Styled boxes representing order statuses.
Styling & Theme:

Use the @cn utility from src/lib/utils for Tailwind class composition.
Background: Subtle gradient or light texture for a premium feel.
Card Styles: Use rounded-lg, shadow-md, and p-3 for smooth appearance.
Typography:
Order Status: Use fontTitle1 (bold, large).
Preparing / Ready: Use fontHeadline (medium bold).
Order Numbers: Use fontBodyLarge.
Component Breakdown:
1️⃣ Header Section
Left Side:

Restaurant Logo (Use <Image> component).
Restaurant Name (Bold text).
Right Side:

Current Time (15:03, updates dynamically).
Fullscreen Toggle (@fullscreenButton.tsx component) with text inside the button like in your image.
Border: 1px solid, padding 16px.
File: src/components/order-status/header.tsx

2️⃣ Orders Grid (Two Columns)
Preparing (Left):

White card background (bg-white-60).
Grid layout (grid-cols-4 gap-2).
Gray Order Cards (border-gray-300, text-black).
Ready (Right):

White card background (bg-white-60).
Grid layout (grid-cols-3 gap-2).
Green Order Cards (bg-green-500 text-white).
The first item ("LATEST READY ORDER") is larger (w-full h-16).
File: src/components/order-status/order-grid.tsx

Responsiveness: For smaller screens (below lg), the Preparing and Ready sections will be split into a 1/2 ratio (i.e., a single column layout).

3️⃣ Order Card Component
Props:

orderNumber: string, status: "preparing" | "ready".
Variants:

preparing: Gray background, black text.
ready: Green background, white text.
For the most recent "Ready" order, the card should be larger (w-full h-16).
